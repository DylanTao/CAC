He worked part-time at Google for a decade on the tech giant\u2019s AI development efforts, but he has since come to have concerns about the technology and his role in advancing it.\n\n\n\n\u201cI console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn\u2019t done it, somebody else would have,\u201d Hinton told the New York Times, which was first to report his decision.\n\n\n\nIn a tweet Monday, Hinton said he left Google so he could speak freely about the risks of AI, rather than because of a desire to criticize Google specifically.\n\n\n\n\u201cI left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google,\u201d Hinton said in a tweet. \u201cGoogle has acted very responsibly.\u201d\n\n\n\nJeff Dean, chief scientist at Google, said Hinton \u201chas made foundational breakthroughs in AI\u201d and expressed appreciation for Hinton\u2019s \u201cdecade of contributions at Google.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to a responsible approach to AI,\u201d Dean said in a statement provided to CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\u201d\n\n\n\nHinton\u2019s decision to step back from the company and speak out on the technology comes as a growing number of lawmakers, advocacy groups and tech insiders have raised alarms about the potential for a new crop of AI-powered chatbots to spread misinformation and displace jobs.\n\n\n\nThe wave of attention around ChatGPT late last year helped renew an arms race among tech companies to develop and deploy similar AI tools in their products. OpenAI, Microsoft and Google are at the forefront of this trend, but IBM, Amazon, Baidu and Tencent are working on similar technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n'The Godfather of AI' quits Google and warns of its dangers. Apple co-founder weighs in\n\n02:44 - Source: CNN\n\nIn March, some prominent figures in tech signed a letter calling for artificial intelligence labs to stop the training of the most powerful AI systems for at least six months, citing \u201cprofound risks to society and humanity.\u201d The letter, published by the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit backed by Elon Musk,came just two weeks after OpenAI announced GPT-4, an even more powerful version of the technology that powers ChatGPT. In early tests and a company demo, GPT-4 was used to draft lawsuits, pass standardized exams and build a working website from a hand-drawn sketch.\n\n\n\nIn the interview with the Times, Hinton echoed concerns about AI\u2019s potential to eliminate jobs and create a world where many will \u201cnot be able to know what is true anymore.\u201d He also pointed to the stunning pace of advancement, far beyond what he and others had anticipated.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people \u2014 a few people believed that,\u201d Hinton said in the interview. \u201cBut most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven before stepping aside from Google, Hinton had spoken publicly about AI\u2019s potential to do harm as well as good.\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe that the rapid progress of AI is going to transform society in ways we do not fully understand and not all of the effects are going to be good,\u201d Hinton said in a 2021 commencement address at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in Mumbai. He noted how AI will boost healthcare while also creating opportunities for lethal autonomous weapons. \u201cI find this prospect much more immediate and much more terrifying than the prospect of robots taking over, which I think is a very long way off.\u201d\n\n\n\nHinton isn\u2019t the first Google employee to raise a red flag on AI. In July, the company fired an engineer who claimed an unreleased AI system had become sentient, saying he violated employment and data security policies. Many in the AI community pushed back strongly on the engineer\u2019s assertion.\n\n\n\nCNN\u2019s Samantha Murphy Kelly and Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report.",
